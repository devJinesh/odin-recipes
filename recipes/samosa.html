    <h1>Samosa Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/samosa.jpg" alt="Tasty Samosas" height="303" width="450">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These little fried parcels of flaky-yet-tender pastry, stuffed to the brim with spiced potatoes and other ingredients,
        are pretty much my idea of the world's greatest savoury snack.</p>
    <p>Not only are they insanely delicious, but they're also incredibly versatile. Samosas can be served as appetisers, entrees, or a lunch on the move.
        They're good hot or at room temperature. They keep for days and days, and they reheat well. What is not to love?!?</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ghee or canola oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>5 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh gingerroot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, ghee, salt and caraway seeds until mixture resembles bread crumbs.
            Gradually stir in enough water to form a firm dough.
            Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until just tender, 8-10 minutes; drain.
            Set aside to cool slightly. In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat.
            Add potatoes and cook until potatoes start to cling to the skillet, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in peas, ginger, garam masala, cumin seeds and salt; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in optional ingredients as desired. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll 1 piece of dough into a 10x6-in. oval. Cut dough in half. Moisten straight edge with water.
            Bring 1 corner of half moon up to meet the other corner of half moon, forming a cone. Pinch seam to seal.
            Fill with 3-4 tablespoons potato mixture. Moisten curved edge of dough with water; fold over top of filling and press seam to seal.
            Gently press the bottom of each samosa to flatten slightly. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat air fryer to 350Â°. Brush the samosas with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil.
            In batches, arrange in a single layer, without touching, on tray in air-fryer basket. Cook until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
